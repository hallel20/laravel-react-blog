This is a simple blog with basic features built using Laravel 11 and ReactJs using Inertia and Vite as the Driver/Connection...

Feel free to fork this code or simply clone it to your machine. PS, This is still a work in progress!

To have admin access, create a new account and then go to the database to manually change the admin to 1 from 0.

I currently have no idea how to do this graphically or using the command line. if there is any update, i will add it to this readme file...

Thank You!!!
